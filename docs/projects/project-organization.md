# Project Organization

Effective project organization helps you navigate your work efficiently and collaborate smoothly with others. TeXlyre provides several tools for organizing, searching, and managing your growing collection of projects.

## Project Dashboard Overview

The project dashboard serves as your primary workspace for accessing and managing all your TeXlyre projects. The interface presents your projects in either grid or list view, with each format offering different advantages for project browsing.

Grid view displays projects as cards with prominent titles, descriptions, and metadata. This visual format works well when you recognize projects by name or visual characteristics and prefer browsing through your collection.

List view presents projects in a compact tabular format with sortable columns for name, creation date, and modification time. This format enables quick scanning of many projects and efficient sorting by various criteria.

### Project Information Display

Each project displays essential information including its title, description, and last modification date. Recent activity indicators help you identify which projects have seen recent work or collaboration.

Project cards show tag information that helps categorize and filter your work. The favorite star indicator marks important projects for quick access, while collaboration indicators show which projects have active sharing.

Creation and modification timestamps help you track project chronology and identify work that might need attention. Sort projects by these dates to focus on recent work or revisit older projects that might need updates.

## Organizing with Favorites

### Marking Important Projects

Star important projects to mark them as favorites, creating a quick-access collection of your most critical work. Favorites appear at the top of sorted project lists and receive special highlighting in the interface.

Use favorites strategically for projects requiring frequent access, active collaboration, or approaching deadlines. Avoid marking too many projects as favorites, as this diminishes the organizational value of the favorite system.

Consider your work patterns when selecting favorites. Current active projects, frequently referenced templates, and ongoing collaborations make good candidates for favorite status.

### Managing Favorite Collections

Review your favorite projects periodically to ensure the collection remains relevant to your current work. Remove favorite status from completed projects or work that no longer requires frequent access.

Favorites function as personal bookmarks rather than permanent project classifications. Feel free to adjust favorite status as your priorities and active projects change over time.

Use favorites in combination with other organizational tools like tags and search to create efficient project discovery workflows that match your working style.

## Search and Filtering

### Project Search

The search function examines project names, descriptions, and tag content to help you locate specific work quickly. Search operates in real-time, updating results as you type to provide immediate feedback.

Use descriptive keywords that might appear in project titles or descriptions when searching. Consider alternative terms or partial matches if your initial search doesn't return expected results.

Search works particularly well for locating projects by topic, collaborator names mentioned in descriptions, or specific terms used in project metadata.

### Tag-Based Filtering

Filter projects by tags to focus on specific categories of work. Tag filtering supports both individual tag selection and combination filtering when you need to find projects matching multiple criteria.

The tag filter dropdown shows all available tags in your project collection along with the number of projects using each tag. This information helps you understand your project distribution and identify useful filtering options.

Clear tag filters to return to the complete project view when you've finished working with filtered results. Multiple filtering sessions can help you explore different aspects of your project organization.

### Advanced Filtering

Combine search terms with tag filters to create precise project selection criteria. This approach helps narrow large project collections to specific subsets that match your current needs.

Use date-based sorting in combination with search and filtering to locate projects from specific time periods. This technique works well for finding projects related to particular courses, jobs, or collaboration periods.

Consider creating systematic search and filter combinations for recurring organizational needs. Document useful filter patterns to recreate them efficiently when needed.

## View Modes and Sorting

### Grid vs List Views

Grid view provides visual browsing that works well when you recognize projects by name and prefer seeing multiple projects simultaneously. The card format displays project information prominently with clear visual separation.

List view enables efficient scanning of project metadata with sortable columns for different organizational criteria. This format works well when managing many projects or when you need to sort by specific attributes.

Switch between view modes based on your current task and personal preference. Both modes provide access to the same project actions and maintain consistent functionality.

### Sorting Options

Sort projects by name to organize them alphabetically, making it easier to locate specific projects when you know their titles. Alphabetical sorting works particularly well with large project collections.

Creation date sorting arranges projects by when you first created them, providing a chronological view of your work history. This sorting helps identify old projects that might need attention or archiving.

Modification date sorting surfaces recently active projects at the top of the list. This sorting mode helps you continue working on current projects and identify collaboration activity.

### Project Selection and Bulk Operations

Select multiple projects for bulk operations like export or organization changes. Project selection mode enables efficient management of project collections without requiring individual project actions.

Use bulk selection strategically for operations like exporting related projects or applying consistent organizational changes across multiple projects simultaneously.

Exit selection mode when you've completed bulk operations to return to normal project browsing and access individual project actions.

## Project Metadata Management

### Updating Project Information

Edit project names and descriptions as your work evolves to maintain accurate project identification. Keep titles current and descriptive to ensure easy project recognition in large collections.

Update project descriptions to reflect current status, goals, or collaboration requirements. Accurate descriptions help collaborators understand project context and requirements.

Review project metadata periodically to ensure information remains current and useful for organization and collaboration purposes.

### Tag Management

Develop consistent tagging strategies that reflect your organizational needs and work patterns. Consider creating tag categories for project type, status, subject area, or collaboration requirements.

Add tags to projects as you create them and update tags as project characteristics change. Consistent tagging from the beginning creates more useful organizational systems.

Remove outdated tags from projects to maintain clean organizational systems. Tag cleanup helps ensure filtering and search operations return relevant results.

### Project Archiving Strategies

Consider your long-term project organization needs as your collection grows. Develop strategies for managing completed projects, reference materials, and experimental work to prevent dashboard clutter.

Use descriptive naming and tagging for projects you might not access frequently but want to preserve. Clear identification helps you locate archived work when needed.

Consider exporting completed projects for long-term storage while maintaining active projects in your TeXlyre workspace. This approach balances preservation with workspace efficiency.

:::tip Organization Evolution
Your organizational system will evolve as your TeXlyre usage patterns become clear. Start with simple categorization and refine your approach based on how you actually use the platform. Effective organization emerges from consistent use rather than perfect initial planning.
