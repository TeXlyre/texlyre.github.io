# Welcome to TeXlyre

TeXlyre is a local-first LaTeX and Typst editor that runs entirely in your browser.

## What Makes TeXlyre Different

TeXlyre prioritizes data ownership and privacy. Documents live in your browser's local storage, not on remote servers. Collaboration happens directly between peers through WebRTC, and compilation runs locally using WebAssembly engines.

Your work remains private while providing the full power of LaTeX and Typst typesetting.

## Getting Started

Choose your path based on your needs:

**For Quick Exploration**: Start with a guest session to try TeXlyre immediately without any setup. Guest sessions provide full functionality but don't persist after you close your browser.

**For Regular Use**: Create a full account to save your projects permanently in your browser. You can upgrade from a guest session at any time.

**For Collaboration**: Share project links with others to begin real-time collaborative editing. No accounts are required for collaborators to join.

:::tip Browser Compatibility
TeXlyre works best in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Some advanced features like file system backup require Chrome or Edge for full functionality.

## Open Source and Community

TeXlyre is released under the AGPL-3.0 license. The source code is available on GitHub, and the project welcomes contributions from the community. The local-first approach means you're never locked into a specific service provider.
