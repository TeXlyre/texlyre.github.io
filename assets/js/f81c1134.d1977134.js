Built with cutting-edge technologies including React, TypeScript, and Yjs, TeXlyre enables collaborative document editing with complete offline capabilities.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Problem with Traditional LaTeX Collaboration\\n\\nTraditional LaTeX collaboration often involves cumbersome workflows: emailing files back and forth, managing version conflicts manually, or relying on cloud services that don\'t understand LaTeX\'s unique requirements. Existing solutions either lack real-time collaboration features or require constant internet connectivity, making them unsuitable for researchers who need to work offline or in low-connectivity environments.\\n\\n## Enter TeXlyre: A New Paradigm\\n\\nTeXlyre addresses these challenges with a **local-first architecture** that prioritizes data ownership, offline capability, and real-time collaboration. Unlike traditional cloud-based solutions, TeXlyre stores all your documents locally while enabling instant synchronization with collaborators when needed.\\n\\n## Key Features That Set TeXlyre Apart\\n\\n### Real-time Collaboration Without Compromise\\n\\nTeXlyre\'s collaboration engine uses **Yjs CRDTs** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for automatic conflict resolution, ensuring that changes from multiple users merge without manual intervention. The platform establishes **WebRTC** peer-to-peer connections, providing ultra-low latency collaboration without routing through external servers.\\n\\n![Multiple users editing simultaneously with different colored cursors](./showcase/collab_cursor_zoomed.png)\\n\\n:::tip Real-time Communication\\n\\nBeyond document editing, TeXlyre includes integrated chat and commenting systems, enabling collaborators to discuss changes and provide feedback directly within the editing environment.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n![Collaborators using the chat panel to discuss progress](./showcase/chat_zoomed.png)\\n\\n### In-Browser LaTeX Compilation\\n\\nOne of TeXlyre\'s most important features is its integration of **SwiftLaTeX WASM engines**, bringing full LaTeX compilation capabilities directly to your browser. No server setup, no external dependencies \u2013 just instant compilation with support for both **pdfTeX** and **XeTeX** engines.\\n\\nThe live compilation system provides:\\n- Immediate feedback with comprehensive syntax highlighting\\n- Real-time error detection and reporting\\n- Integrated PDF viewer with advanced navigation\\n- Side-by-side editing for optimal workflow\\n\\n![LaTeX compilation in progress with error panel and PDF output](./showcase/error_parser_zoomed.png)\\n\\n:::info Technical Achievement\\n\\nRunning LaTeX compilation entirely in the browser represents a significant technical achievement, eliminating the complexity of server-side compilation while maintaining full feature parity with traditional LaTeX workflows.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### True Local-First Architecture\\n\\nTeXlyre\'s **local-first design** ensures that your data remains under your control:\\n\\n- **Complete offline functionality**: Edit documents without internet connectivity\\n- **IndexedDB storage**: All documents stored securely in your browser\\n- **Automatic synchronization**: Resync when connectivity returns  \\n- **File System Access API**: Direct folder synchronization for external backups\\n- **Full data portability**: Export and import projects across devices\\n\\n### Comprehensive File Management\\n\\nThe platform includes a sophisticated file management system supporting:\\n\\n- Drag-and-drop operations for various file types\\n- **Document linking** between collaborative documents and static files\\n- **FilePizza integration** for secure peer-to-peer file sharing\\n- Support for LaTeX sources, images, data files, and more\\n\\n![Project dashboard with file explorer and project cards](./showcase/project_viewer_zoomed.png)\\n\\n## Getting Started with TeXlyre\\n\\n### Quick Installation\\n\\nSetting up TeXlyre for development requires Node.js 18+ and a modern browser:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/TeXlyre/texlyre.git\\ncd texlyre\\nnpm install\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\nNavigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the application. The beauty of TeXlyre is its simplicity \u2013 create a new project and start editing immediately, or share a collaboration URL with team members for instant access.\\n\\n### Template-Based Quick Start\\n\\nTeXlyre provides various templates to jumpstart your projects, from academic papers to technical documentation.\\n\\n![Getting started with a template](./showcase/templates_zoomed.png)\\n\\n:::tip Collaboration URLs\\n\\nTeXlyre uses simple URLs like `http://localhost:5173/#yjs:abc123def456` to enable instant collaboration access. Just share the link with your team members!\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Technical Architecture\\n\\n### Local-First with Real-Time Sync\\n\\nTeXlyre\'s architecture elegantly balances **local-first principles** with real-time collaboration needs:\\n\\n- **React frontend** provides responsive user interface\\n- **Yjs documents** stored in IndexedDB for offline-first functionality  \\n- **WebRTC connections** enable direct peer-to-peer synchronization\\n- **SwiftLaTeX WASM engines** handle LaTeX compilation in-browser\\n\\n### Extensible Plugin System\\n\\nThe **plugin architecture** allows for extensive customization:\\n\\n```typescript\\ninterface ViewerPlugin extends Plugin {\\n  type: \'viewer\';\\n  canHandle: (fileType: string, mimeType?: string) => boolean;\\n  renderViewer: React.ComponentType<ViewerProps>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlugins can extend TeXlyre with:\\n- Custom file viewers and renderers\\n- LaTeX log processors\\n- Backup providers\\n- Theme variations\\n\\n![Bib Editor plugin integrated in to the TeXlyre app](./showcase/bib_editor_zoomed.png)\\n\\n## Advanced File Synchronization\\n\\n### Local File System Integration\\n\\nThe File System Access API enables TeXlyre to work directly with local folders, supporting workflows that integrate with cloud storage providers like Dropbox or Google Drive.
